    <div class="ukb-1">
        <p>"Success is not measured by the heights you reach, but by the obstacles you overcome. 
            It's in those moments of struggle and perseverance that your true strength shines, 
            and your dreams become realities. So, keep climbing, keep pushing, and never lose 
            sight of the summit, for that's where your greatness awaits."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-2">
        <p>"Life is a journey with no guarantees, but with every step you take, you're writing 
            your own story. Embrace the challenges, for they are the chapters that make your 
            tale unique and memorable. The pen is in your hand, and the power to create the life 
            you desire lies within. Keep writing, and make it a masterpiece."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-3">
        <p>"Courage is not the absence of fear; it's the determination to move forward in spite 
            of it. Your greatest moments often lie just beyond your comfort zone, and with each 
            step you take, you become stronger, braver, and closer to your dreams. Embrace your 
            fears as stepping stones to success."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-4">
        <p>"The road to success is not a straight path; it's a winding journey filled with twists, 
            turns, and unexpected detours. Remember, it's not about how fast you reach your destination 
            but how well you navigate the path. Stay resilient, adapt to change, and keep moving 
            forward. Your destination is worth the adventure."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ukb-1">
        <p>"Opportunities don't happen. You create them. Every day is a chance to start anew, to set 
            new goals, and to chase your dreams. Don't wait for the perfect moment; make the moment 
            perfect by seizing it with determination and purpose. Your future is crafted by the choices 
            you make today."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ukb-2">
        <p>"Your potential is not determined by your circumstances but by your choices. Every sunrise 
            is a fresh canvas, and every moment is an opportunity to paint the life you desire. Believe 
            in yourself, take action with passion, and watch as your dreams take shape in the colors of 
            your commitment and persistence."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-3">
        <p>"Life's challenges are not roadblocks; they are stepping stones to growth and resilience. 
            Embrace adversity as a teacher, failure as a friend, and setbacks as setups for comebacks. 
            Your journey is a testament to your strength, and every obstacle you overcome is a chapter 
            in your remarkable story of success."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-4">
        <p>"In the darkest of moments, you have the power to be your own light. Remember, stars shine 
            brightest in the darkest skies. So, when life seems tough, let your inner strength and 
            determination light the way to your dreams, and don't let anything dim your radiance."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-1">
        <p>"The journey to success may be filled with sweat, tears, and doubts, but it's also where you'll 
            discover your true potential. Keep moving forward, for with every step, you inch closer to the 
            extraordinary. Your dreams are not destinations; they are the milestones that make the journey 
            worthwhile."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="ukb-2">
        <p>"Believe in yourself, for in your belief lies the power to achieve. The journey may be challenging, 
            but within those challenges are the seeds of your growth. Embrace each day with purpose, and your 
            determination will be the wind beneath your wings. Your potential is limitless; you are the author 
            of your story, the architect of your dreams. So, write boldly and build grandly."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-3">
        <p>"Life is a canvas, and you are the artist. Paint it with the colors of passion, purpose, and persistence. 
            Embrace each brushstroke as a chance to create a masterpiece. Your potential is a work in progress; keep 
            adding layers until your vision comes to life. The art of your life is a reflection of the creativity within 
            your heart."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ukb-4">
        <p>"Success is not a destination; it's a journey. Each step you take, each obstacle you conquer, brings you 
            closer to your dreams. Your resilience in the face of adversity defines your character. Don't be afraid 
            to stumble; it's a chance to stand taller. Keep moving forward, for your path is paved with the stones 
            of determination."</p>
